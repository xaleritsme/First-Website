            <p class="aboutme">My name is Aleksander Piprek. I was born in Krynica-Zdrój. Currently, I am studying Mechatronic Engineering in the AGH in Cracow. I hope one day to become a successful engineer that may contribute in the fields of producing power out of fusion, solving the great unification theory and many more! I enjoy making all kinds of music, varying from techno, metal to trap beats. Also I love every sport that there is. Krynica-Zdrój has lots of mountains around itself so why not use that? During winter Krynica is rich in snow so naturally... there are lots of ski slopes! I can both skii and snowboard. But during the summer before my first year in college I went to Croatia to acquire a basic certificate in scuba diving. My current certificate licenses me to dive with the help of a instructor to up to 18 meters. Just that 18 meters under water for about 20 minutes is enough for you to get the full thrill of scuba diving. If you got to this point of my introduction then I suggest, that you should try it too! It's completely worth it.</p>
